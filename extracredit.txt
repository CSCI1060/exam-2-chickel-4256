The input code translates to:

‘I WISH IT NEED NOT HAVE HAPPENED IN MY TIME,’ SAID
FRODO.
‘SO DO I,’ SAID GANDALF, ‘AND SO DO ALL WHO LIVE TO
SEE SUCH TIMES. BUT THAT IS NOT FOR THEM TO DECIDE.
ALL WE HAVE TO DECIDE IS WHAT TO DO WITH THE TIME
THAT IS GIVEN, US.

A passage from JRR Tolkien's book, "The Fellowship of the Ring" (one of my personal favorite books)
It was written in a ceasar cipher of 3

The cipher function I wrote in class got most of the characters right but 
could not handle spaces or characters that wrapped around a or z 
so I went over to the class website to download the ceasar cipher
example. After struggling with proper location and file names, I finally 
got the class code to output, what I presume, is the proper text.
