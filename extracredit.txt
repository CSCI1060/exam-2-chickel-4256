The input code translates to:

‘I WISH IT NEED NOT HAVE HAPPENED IN MY TIME,’ SAID
FRODO.
‘SO DO I,’ SAID GANDALF, ‘AND SO DO ALL WHO LIVE TO
SEE SUCH TIMES. BUT THAT IS NOT FOR THEM TO DECIDE.
ALL WE HAVE TO DECIDE IS WHAT TO DO WITH THE TIME
THAT IS GIVEN, US.

A passage from JRR Tolkien's book, "The Fellowship of the Ring" (one of my personal favorite books)

It was written in a ceasar cipher of 3

The cipher function I wrote in class got most of the characters right but 
could not handle spaces or characters that wrapped around a or z 
so I went over to the class website to download the ceasar cipher
example. After struggling with proper location and file names, I finally 
got the class code to output, what I presume, is the proper text. 

I determined the cipher key was 3 by writing out the first few words on paper to see whether or not my keys were giberish. I chose to try a 3 and 11 since there are a number of occurances of single letter words, which in english (which I assumed was the language of the cipher) means it must be either I or A, so I adjusted the alphabet to have L at both I and A respectivly. A key of 3 makes I the proper translation for L, and so I ran the whole text through the cipher decoder and got the above output.
